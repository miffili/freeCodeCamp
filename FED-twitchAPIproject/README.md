### Twitch.tv Previewer for [freeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/challenges/use-the-twitchtv-json-api)

#### Assignment
Use the Twitch.tv JSON API. Use whichever libraries or APIs you need. Give it your own personal style.  
Fulfill the below **user stories**:
- as a user, I can see whether Free Code Camp is currently streaming on Twitch.tv  
- as a user, I can click the status output & be sent directly to the Free Code Camp's Twitch.tv channel  

#### Implementation
Another challenge using an API. I have to admit that familiarizing with the API took a little longer this time. But it all worked out just fine in the end. With this project, I decided to stick with certain style elements to achieve a similar look throughout all of the intermediate & advanced projects.

#### Made with
- HTML, CSS, JavaScript  
- jQuery  
- official Twitch icons
